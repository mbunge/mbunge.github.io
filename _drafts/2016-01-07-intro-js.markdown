Today I will show you how to setup the project foundation, with all tools and services mentioned <a href="http://www.marco-bunge.com/2015/10/23/blast-the-modern-application-wrapper/" target="_blank">in post "Tools and services for modern applications"</a>. We will also create our first class, test it and explore the magical continious integration process. Feel free to ask questions! I would also be happy if you share this post.

## Intro

I assume that Git and Composer has already installed and a <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account exists.

If you use composer from phar please replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` in this how to!

## Setup php unit

PHP unit is a great piece of code - developed by Sebastian Bergmann - to ensure quality of your application. Writing test code is as much nessacary as writing good application code to avoid writing weak or useless tests.

Getting PHP Unit with composer.

```
$ composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

Creating a phpunit xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit backupGlobals="false"
         backupStaticAttributes="false"
         bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
         colors="true"
         convertErrorsToExceptions="true"
         convertNoticesToExceptions="true"
         convertWarningsToExceptions="true"
         processIsolation="false"
         stopOnFailure="false"
         syntaxCheck="false"
        >
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Package Test Suite">
            <directory suffix=".php">./tests/</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
    <filter>
        <whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true">
            <directory suffix=".php">./src</directory>
            <exclude>
                <directory>./build</directory>
                <directory>./composer</directory>
                <directory>./tests</directory>
                <directory>./travis</directory>
                <directory>./vendor</directory>
            </exclude>
        </whitelist>
    </filter>
</phpunit>
```

## Continious Integration

We will use travis-ci, a free continious integration service.
