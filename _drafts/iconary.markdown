# Interview with founders of iconary
## Revolution of dictionaries audience?

Laura invited me to like Iconary fan page on facebook a while ago. Iconary is new dictionary app with a very special story. I'm happy to interview Laura from Icanory.

### 1. Hello Laura, who are you and what is your job at Iconary?
I'm 31 years old and work as online-conceptioner for a digital agency in Bremen, Germany. Before that I worked as media designer. I'm working for 13 years in the advertising, design and media branch. I engage with Iconary as my own private project beside my job for the past months. I'm responsible for idea and concept, design and marketing and a huge amount of orgenizing at Iconary.

### 2. How do you hit upon the idea of creating Iconary?
I want to take action since a refugee camp has been established last year in summertime in the near of our office located in Überseestadt (Bremen, Germany). Along with a friend, I started to teach german once a week. And of course it's like a drop in a bucket. My wish was to make something avaiable for the peoable, when I'm not able teaching them. In addition I looked for a project where I could test myself and which inceases my competences combined with my interestes and personal life in he digital world. Most refugees own a smart phone and an app suggests itself.

### 3. Iconary is an app designed for iOS and Android. Who should use Iconary and which advantages do Icanory have? (Was macht Iconary besonders und für wen ist es gedacht?)
I start with research for similar projects and of course their are a lot dictionary apps. But there was no pure icon dictionary which was made for refugees. My goal was to outdo the other apps, while I deliver a free app, which is accessible in offline mode, has a small file size, has an authentic recorded voice response. The app should also have a good appearance and a very good usability. A dictionary app combined with these features is an innovation. My goal was to start and just realize this idea, instead of to keep pace with the well-known apps.

We ascertain that Iconary helps everyone which would like to improve it own languge skills. We are also figured out that the colored icons and the good usability appear very fine to kids.

### 4. Does the idea fit the final app? (Ist das Endergebnis von Iconary so, wie ihr es euch zu Anfang vorgestellt habt?)
### 5. Success and disappointments are always part of product development. What is your expierence? (Welche Erfolgserlebnisse oder Enttäuschungen habt ihr bisher erlebt?)
### 6. "Refugees" are a hotly debated topic in politics and in the media. How does the debate affect your team? (Die Flüchlingsfrage ist sehr brisant. In politischen Lagern gibt es positive und nagative Meinung zur aktuellen Lage. Wie beeinflusst euch das in eurem Tun?)
### 7. Their is always a team behind a product. What is the iconary team size and which key skills do your team have? (Mit welchen Kompetenzen ist euer Team ausgestellt und wie groß seit Ihr?)
### 8. Finances are an essential part for further product development. How is Iconary funded? (Finanzen sind ein wichtiger und entscheidener Faktor für das Fortbestehen eines Produktes. Finanziert sich Iconary durch Bootstraping, Venture Capital oder ganz anders?)
### 9. Iconary is already broken into the market. What do you desire for the future of Iconary? (Iconary ist bereits am Markt, wie sieht die Zukunft von Iconary aus?)
### 10. Thank you very much and further luck with Iconary! (Closing words / Schlussworte)
