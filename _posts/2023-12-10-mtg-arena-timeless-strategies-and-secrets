# MTG Arena Timeless: Unleash the beast

## Introduction

Magic: The Gathering (MTG) Arena introduces a thrilling new format: Timeless. This format, which blends elements from across the MTG universe, offers players an unparalleled experience. In this blog post, we'll delve into the nuances of Timeless, exploring powerful cards and new delve mechanics that can help you dominate this new battlefield. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the Arena, this introduction will provide valuable insights into making the most of your Timeless adventures.

## Khans of Tarkir introduces the Delve mechanic

Delve is a keyword that allows you to exile cards from your graveyard to help pay for the mana cost of a spell. This mechanic shines in Timeless, where graveyards often fill up quickly, thanks to fetchlands and early interaction. Delve transforms your graveyard into a resource, reducing the cost of powerful spells. The strategy lies in carefully selecting which cards to exile, balancing the immediate benefits of casting potent spells against potential future uses of those graveyard cards.

## Synergy of Fetchlands with Brainstorm, Mishra's Bauble, and Deathrite Shaman

The Timeless format introduces Fetchlands from Khans of Takir in MTG Arena. Fetchlands, known for their ability to thin the deck and manage land types, become even more powerful when combined with **Brainstorm**. This classic synergy allows you to shuffle away unwanted cards drawn with Brainstorm, ensuring a fresh draw.

**Mishra's Bauble**, offers deck thinning and information gathering, providing a peek at the top card of either player's deck. The combination with Fetchlands ensures you're not drawing into something you don't need.

**Deathrite Shaman**, a versatile creature, gains additional utility in this environment. It can manipulate graveyards, which is critical considering the fetchland's ability to fill graveyards rapidly. Notably, Deathrite Shaman's prowess has led to its ban in both Modern and Legacy formats due to its high power level.

## My Personal Favorite Cards in Timeless

Timeless will usher in a diverse range of powerful cards and interactions. My focus is on the top 5 cards that I believe will be most influential in shaping the format.

### Oko, Thief of Crowns
A versatile planeswalker capable of disrupting opponents by turning their key assets into mere Elks.

### Teferi, Time Raveler
This card offers both protection for your spells and disruption to your opponent's timing. Its synergy with various strategies makes it a staple in Timeless decks.

### Necropotence
The ability to exchange life for cards and its ease of inclusion in a variety of decks make it a highly potent card.

### Deathrite Shaman
As mentioned earlier, this card's ability to manipulate graveyards and provide mana acceleration makes it a powerhouse, despite its ban in other formats.

### Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer
A recent addition to the MTG universe, Ragavan brings both aggression and resource advantage, making it a formidable card in Timeless.

## My Personal Favorite Decks for Timeless

Following the introduction of Timeless, I began gathering inspiration from Legacy and Vintage formats.

### UW Combo
This deck is built around the Teferi, Time Raveler and Displacer Kitten combo. It aims to control the game and eventually win with Monastery Mentor or leveraging the Power 9 from Oracle of the Alpha. The synergy and control elements make it a formidable choice in the Timeless format.

### Jund Sneak Attack
Focusing on fast wins, this deck utilizes Sneak Attack to bring in heavy hitters like **Griselbrand**, **Atraxa, Grand Unifier**, or **Worldspine Wurm**. It's a deck that rewards strategic play and timing, offering explosive turns that can swiftly end the game.

## Conclusion

The Timeless format in MTG Arena offers a rich and diverse playing field, blending elements from various MTG eras into one exciting package. Whether it's the strategic depth offered by Fetchlands and the Delve mechanic, the power of standout cards like Oko and Teferi, or the thrill of piloting finely-tuned decks like UW Combo and Jund Sneak Attack, Timeless has something for every Magic enthusiast.
