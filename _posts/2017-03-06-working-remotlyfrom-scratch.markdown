## From local to remote work

Six month ago, I've got my first expierience with remote work. One day each week, we were free to ork at home or any other desired place. 
That's a big deal between you and your employer. Both need to trust each other. I could pick up my wife and dog and go for hiking. When 
arrived in the hotel I work for a couple of hours. Pure mobility and remote work.

Nowadys I changed the company and start to work remotly as a software development lead. I could be everywhere, but I als need to meet some 
conditions.

First of all I need to be available for meetings which could take place between 10am and 15pm. I also need to work 40 hours a week. I need 
to visit the office once a week.

As you can see I archived more freedom with my work. But more freedom means also more decipline. I start my day with a big cup of coffee, 
a shower, brushed tees and wearing reputable clothers. My day starts between 6:00 am and 7:00 am and I start to work between 7:30 am and 9:00 am. 

Between 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm a have launch. 

__Every single workday!__

## You may ask, why should I work remotly when I also need to keep the office time?

I'm able to integrate my home life into your work life. And I increase my productivity, because the travel destinations are most likly 
comfortable places for me. That means I'm relaxed, don't need to be scared of collegues which have a questions about every 3 minutes or 
any other trouble.
