## A mind changer?

__Form follows fiction__ is replaceing _Form Follows Function_ and describes a design approach which is based on it's stories. This means for architecture, that a building is representing a story. In my opinion this approach should be project onto each type of design. A product, a website, your garden, all these things should representing a story.

I recommend this inspiring TED talk by Ole Scheeren:
