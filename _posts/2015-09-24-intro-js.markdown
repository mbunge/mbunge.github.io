Usabli.ca has published a nice introduction tool for your products called Intro.js.

## Getting startet in few steps

### Download all sources with Bower

```bower install intro.js --save```

These sources will be loaded in your "bower_components" folder.

> __Tip__: Tp find the correct bower folder, check out your .bowerrc and look for your "directory" option. If you don't have a .bowerrc file, your default folder will be _bower\_components_
