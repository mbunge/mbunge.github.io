We developed a REST-API for a customer project and used slack for debugging and error monitoring to get immediate response what happends on production.

We realized this with a PHP, Symfony HTTP-Foundation and monolog PSR-3 logger.

Positive was the immediate feedback, logging and monitoring of errors. A negative point was the massive flood of messages. Therefore we create a cluster of channels one for errors one for interactive debugging.

A great way to use slack in combination with your team.
