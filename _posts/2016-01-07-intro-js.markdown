Today I will show you how to setup the project foundation, with all tools and services mentioned (in this post)[http://www.marco-bunge.com/2015/10/23/blast-the-modern-application-wrapper/]. We will also create our first class, test it build it and will explore the magic CI process. Feel free to ask questions! I would also be happy if you share this post.
