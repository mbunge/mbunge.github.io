Jund Sneak Attack is a midrange combo deck for MTG Arean Timeless Best-Of-Three format that wins with big creatures and heavy board presence using *Sneak Attack* or *Natural Order*.

This deck aims to use accelerators like *Dark Ritual*, *Deathrite Shaman*, *Delightful Halfling*, or Treasure Tokens generated by *Fable of the Mirror Breaker* to get big, game-ending creatures like *Atraxa, Grand Unifier* or *Worldspine Worm* into the game as quickly as possible with *Sneak Attack* or *Natural Order*. *Fable of the Mirror Breaker*, *Demonic Tutor*, or *Questing Druid // Sneak the Beast* helps find *Sneak Attack* or *Natural Order*. To protect yourself in the early rounds, Jund Sneak Attack has disruption like *Orcish Bowmaster*, *Thoughtseize*, and *Boseiju, Who Endures*.
