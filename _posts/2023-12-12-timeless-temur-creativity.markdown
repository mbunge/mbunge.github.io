Temur Creativity is a combo-control deck that uses card advantage, permission and token generators to set up *Indomitable Creativity*. This transforms tokens into *Xenagos, God of Revels* alongside *Emrakul, The Promised End*. Once in play, Xenagos doubles Emrakul's power, enabling a swift and overwhelming attack to immediately end the game.

At its core, the deck aims to generate tokens using *Oko, Thief of Crowns*, *Minsc & Boo*, *Fable of the Mirror-Breaker* and *Dwarven Mine*. These tokens serve as fodder for *Indomitable Creativity*. *Memory Lapse* and *Spell Pierce* protect the combo from disruption and counteract the opponent's plays. *Veil of Summer* is added to the mainboard due to the anticipated meta of blue permission and black disruption. *Lightning Bolt* offers a direct way to deal with opposing creatures, maintaining board control. For consistency and digging deeper into the library to find the necessary combo pieces, the deck uses *Brainstorm*, *Treasure Cruise*, and *Fetchlands*.
