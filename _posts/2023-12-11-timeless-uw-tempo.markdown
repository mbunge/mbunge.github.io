UW Tempo is a tempo-combo deck designed for the MTG Arena Timeless format. Centered around the **Teferi, Time Raveler** and **Displacer Kitten** synergy, this deck focuses on controlling the early game, executing the combo with **Teferi, Time Raveler** and **Displacer Kitten**, and ultimately securing victory through Monastery Mentor, Thassa's Oracle, or by utilizing the Power 9 from the Oracle of the Alpha's spellbook.

## A Word on Numbers and Choices

This deck might evolve based on the metagame. Employing a mix of permission spells, removal spells, and card advantage often proves to be a successful strategy, both with and without the integrated combo. The selection of cards and lands is determined by the likelihood of drawing a specific effect and the aim of ensuring an excellent starting hand.

## Common Lines

Each combo turn begins with **Displacer Kitten** and **Teferi, Time Raveler**. The objective is to generate mana and draw your win conditions. A typical strategy involves establishing a loop with **Displacer Kitten**, cycling **Teferi, Time Raveler** and **Mox Amber** for virtually infinite blue and white mana, and using **Teferi, Time Raveler** and **Mishra's Bauble** for endless card draw.

**Mox Amber** is the primary initiator of the combo. With three lands and **Teferi, Time Raveler** on the field by turn three, you can play Mox Amber on turn four, produce **symbol:u**, utilize **Teferi, Time Raveler**'s -3 ability to return **Mox Amber** to your hand and draw a card. Then, cast **Displacer Kitten** followed by **Mox Amber**, triggering the Kitten's ability to target **Teferi, Time Raveler**. Continue looping **Teferi, Time Raveler**'s -3 ability to return **Mox Amber** to your hand, draw a card, and play **Mox Amber**, repeatedly targeting **Teferi, Time Raveler** with the Kitten's ability.

**Mishra's Bauble** serves as an additional combo enabler alongside **Mox Amber**. The sequence mirrors that of **Mox Amber**, requiring both **Teferi, Time Raveler** and **Displacer Kitten** on the battlefield. Continue the loop until you acquire **Mox Amber**, then proceed with the combo using **Mox Amber**.

Once **Oracle of the Alpha** has introduced the Power 9 into the library, the combo can also be activated using **Mox Pearl**, **Mox Sapphire**, **Mox Jet**, **Mox Ruby**, or **Mox Emerald**.

To clinch the game with the combo, you can either deplete your library and play **Thassa's Oracle** or amass a large number of Monks with **Monastery Mentor**, aiming for a win in the following turn.

## Core

4 **Teferi, Time Raveler**
3-4 **Displacer Kitten**
3-4 **Mishra's Bauble**
1-2 **Mox Amber**
2-4 **Monastery Mentor**

**Displacer Kitten** is the beating heart of the combo. It is able to protect itself against **Lightning Bolt** and **Fatal Push** by target itself with it's ability. Three should be enough, due to several possibilities of finding and filtering.

**Teferi, Time Raveler** serves as the second component of the combo. Beyond its role in the combo, it offers virtual card advantage by neutralizing permission spells and disrupting strategies based on Dreadhorde Arcanist or Wilderness Reclamation. Additionally, it aids in buying time and locating combo pieces by temporarily neutralizing a threat.

**Mox Amber** serves as mana accelerator and combo enable.

**Mishra's Bauble** is another component of the combo. Additionally, it acts as a zero-mana card advantage engine, effectively functioning as a scry 1 when combined with a fetchland, and drawing a card at the next upkeep.

**Counterspell** and **Spell Pierce** serve two crucial functions in the deck. Firstly, they address combo hate cards such as **Thalia, Guardian of Thraben**, **Deafening Silence**, **Blood Moon**, and **Defense Grid**. Secondly, they effectively counter early threats like **Beseech the Mirror**, **Sneak Attack**, **Natural Order**, and **Wilderness Reclamation**. 

**Monastery Mentor** fits exceptionally well within the tempo-oriented game plan and serves as a formidable win condition, both with and without the **Displacer Kitten** and **Teferi, Time Raveler** combo. It can grow significantly in a short time due to the numerous non-creature spells in the deck. It functions effectively on its own and synergizes well with the combo involving **Displacer Kitten** and **Teferi, Time Raveler**.

## Other Card Choices

**Thassa's Oracle** serves as an alternative win condition in the deck.

**Oracle of the Alpha** introduces additional combo pieces through the Power 9. It also provides a solid 2/3 body and scrys 1 with each attack, enhancing both board presence and deck manipulation.

**Reprieve** and **Swords to Plowshares** safeguard the early game stages.

**Brainstorm** stands out as the premier draw spell in Timeless, offering access to three potential solutions from the library. Furthermore, it shuffle away two undesired cards from the hand, when used with Fetchlands.

**LÃ³rien Revealed** replaces itself with a necessary **Snow-Covered Island**'s or **Hallowed Fountain** or drawing three cards in the mid to late game.

**Seek New Knowledge** and **Dig Through Time** offer additional card advantage, enabling the swift discovery of solutions at instant speed.

## Mana Base

The deck is designed to consistently supply blue and white mana.

**Flooded Strand** and **Polluted Delta** are essential for locating the necessary mana sources and work well in conjunction with **Brainstorm**, **Mishra's Bauble**, and **Dig Through Time**.

**Hallowed Fountain** offers both blue and white mana and is accessible via either **Flooded Strand** or **Polluted Delta**.

**Seachrome Coast** delivers quick access to blue and white mana.

Beyond the multicolored mana, the deck features **Snow-Covered Island** and **Snow-Covered Plains** as a strategy against **Blood Moon**.

**Otawara, Soaring City** not only provides blue mana but also temporarily neutralizes a threat.


## Sideboard

Given the unpredictability of the metagame, the sideboard is designed to adapt to expected strategies. Its composition may undergo significant changes based on the metagame.

**Disdainful stroke** is an excellent option against large spells such as **Beseech the Mirror**, **Sneak Attack**, **Natural Order**, and **Wilderness Reclamation**, among others.

**Mystical Dispute** is effective against blue-based control and tempo decks, as well as specific threats like **Oko, Thief of Crowns** and **Teferi, Time Raveler**.

**Rest in Peace** is instrumental in disrupting graveyard-centric strategies, including those utilizing **Dreadhorde Arcanist**, **Underworld Breach**, and **Lurrus of the Dream-Den**.

**Sunset Revelry** is valuable in aggressive matchups that apply pressure in the early to mid-game stages.

**Supreme Verdict** provides a countermeasure against various creature-based strategies.

**The Stone Brain** allows for the extraction of a crucial spell from the opponent's library. Making the right choice can be challenging in an undeveloped metagame, thus leveraging all information from game one is crucial.

## Weakness

The UW Tempo deck faces significant challenges against opponents with **Orcish Bowmaster**, hand disruption strategies, especially paired with **Dreadhorde Arcanist**, and fast-paced aggro decks.

## Strength

UW Tempo offers a variety of responses through its permission spells, removal options, and **Teferi, Time Raveler**, enabling it to effectively control the game.

## Adjustments & Outlook

UW Tempo has the potential to adapt to the metagame, thanks to its straightforward tempo game plan. This adaptability is further enhanced by the flexibility of its card choices and sideboard adjustments. For instance, **Counterspell** could be exchanged for **Memory Lapse**, or **Dig Through Time** might be substituted with **Treasure Cruise** to reduce reliance on double blue mana, especially when splashing for another color. The quantity of **Mox Amber** in the deck could be increased if more legendary creatures or planeswalkers are incorporated. The deck could evolve by focusing more on the combo aspect, possibly splashing an additional color for efficient storm cards like **Grapeshot**. Alternatively, the current combo could be swapped out for more streamlined threats, laying the groundwork for the deck's next evolutionary step.
